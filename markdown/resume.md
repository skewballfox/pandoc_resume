## Education

### In Progress


#### 2018-2020 BSc, Computer Science ; University of Southern Mississippi

#### Minor: Mathematics

##### Important Classes

Data Structures

- Teacher emphasized importance of modularity of code, controlling every possible error, and human readability
- I took this while working which allowed me to better contribute to the company as a programmer
- The quality of my code improved greatly because of this class

Probability and Statistics 2

- Teacher made an initially difficult subject rather approachable
- Class prompted me to start exploring the connections between computer science and mathematics

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

- Built my first machine learning algorithm in class(naive bayes classifier)
- Like the above, it prompted me to start exploring connections between a series of personal interest (game theory, cognitive science, human learning, etc) and computer science

#### 2016-2017 Computer Science** ; Pearl River Community College

## Experience

**Innovative Imaging and Research Corp : Summer 2017, Summer 2018 : Intern**

- Participated in daily scrums to understand current task requirements and keep coworkers informed
    on progress
- Translated Matlab Code from old project to python so that the software could be run independently on a Raspberry Pi.
- Tested capabilities of Raspberry Pi camera for image processing task using OpenCV library.
- Gathered data to be used for calibration of drone mounted cameras.
- Tested capabilities of cameras for low flying batch capture.
- Assembled and tested drones, and configured necessary software, for course to be taught by coworker to air force personnel
- Wrote code to automate image processing task
- Programmed arduino in C to remotely control(initially via bluetooth) an actuator door for satelite calibration equipment
- Developed a project proposal for a design which aimed to simplify an existing project (composed of 2 interdependent raspberry Pi’s hard wired to multiple sensors and actuators) by switching to a configuration using a series of independent arduinos connected over LAN to a single remotely controlled Pi. This
    would have improved the projects resiliance to critical failure, allowed for remote diagnostics, simplified set up and maitenance, as well as lowered the associated cost.

## Technical Experience

### Notable Projects


**[Naive Bayes Classifier](https://github.com/skewballfox/Classes/blob/master/Intro_to_AI/Programming_Assignment_2/naive_digit_classifier.py)**

Classifies handwritten digits stored as ascii text with 77.4% accuracy using only binary features, logs all output useful for analysis under normal run and all necessary debugging information if debug information is desired. metadata is stored in a separate JSON file.

**[Sauron's Eye](https://github.com/skewballfox/SauronsEye)** 

Motion detection program I wrote in C++ that used the OpenCV library
that would capture photos where a change in values above a certain size was
detected and upload the photos to google drive. The original intent was to provide visual documentation of events in case of theft or break-in. The program is launched and ended by an unincluded script for screenlocking. I hope to add things like object detection and facial recognition using already existing solutions.
